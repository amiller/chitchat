            <p>This is a game played with three people, the ‘buyer’, the ‘seller’ and the ‘insurer’. The buyer and seller start with 25 cent bonuses. Additionally, the seller starts out with a ‘gold token’, which he can sell to the buyer for 25 cents. If the buyer ends up with the gold token, he’ll earn a 50 cent bonus. So if the buyer and seller make a deal, then everyone earns 50 cents.</p>
<p>However, the buyer has to go first. The seller has to be trusted to give the gold token on his turn. All the three parties keep whatever bonus they have at the end of the game! The buyer and seller cannot speak directly to each other, but they can both chat with the insurer. The insurer’s job is to help make a fair deal.</p>
<p>After 5 minutes, the game will end and you will be asked to fill out a survey questionnaire. You must complete the entire survey in order to receive the $1 payment.</p>
